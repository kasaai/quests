# Quests

This repository keeps track of current and upcoming projects in insurance. It is meant to faciliate recruiting of collaborators, avoid duplication of effort, and provide visibility into the latest research. The projects are loosely organized by actuarial discipline. They may lead to academic papers, tutorials, and software, including contributions to existing software packages.

While the current projects are predominantly P&C focused due to the background of initial participants, we highly encourage practitioners from other disciplines to suggest interesting and impactful topics.

See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/kasaai/quests/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on proposing projects.
