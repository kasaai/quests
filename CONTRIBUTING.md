# Proposing a project

To propose a project, simply open an issue with a description. This can be very brief if you'd like to solicit comments and ideas, but it's important to highlight the potential practical impact. 

Currently, the scope of the community includes topics that involve applied AI, so appropriate projects tend to have mathematical or software content, or otherwise is directly applicable to advancing the use of AI in insurance. Note that we are not a marketing platform.

We encourage you to check out (and contribute to) [kasaai/references](https://github.com/kasaai/references) for ideas.

# Project guidelines

We aim to be as inclusive as possible, but here are a few requirements to ensure the projects are aligned with our mission:

1. Whenever possible, utilize publicly available data. If proprietary data is required, attempt to perform some experiments with simulated data.
2. Clearly state the open source license for the project. We recommend a popular [OSI approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses) for software and a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) for media, such as blog posts, research papers, and tutorials.
3. Whenever possible, preprints should be submitted to [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) in addition to the researchers' preferred outlet.

We emphasize that the project collaborators have full control of when materials are shared, e.g. they may release code only when the first preprint is made available, but they should intend to achieve full reproducibility in the final result.

# Keeping up with the times

As we scale up in number of projects and contributors, we will, with feedback from the community, adjust this document as necessary to ensure things run smoothly.
