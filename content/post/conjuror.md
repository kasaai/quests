Data simulators are important for advancing insurance research because publicly available datasets from industry are scarce. The conjuror package and conventions aim to unify the interfaces of data simulation packages and make them more accessible to researchers and practitioners. It provides a set of standardized methods and functions for package authors to implement and use, along with a set of principles for each research discipline developed with input from the community.
